## Project Overview

The Airline Management System is a backend application designed to efficiently manage airline operations, including airplanes, flights, and passenger reservations. Developed using Spring Boot, the application exposes RESTful API endpoints to handle key functionalities such as flight management, airplane assignments, and reservation handling.

## Key Features

- **Airplane & Flight Management**: Seamlessly manage airplanes, flights, and associated reservations.
- **Relational Data Handling**:
  - Airplanes can be assigned by multiple flights.
  - Each flight is associated with an airplane.
  - Reservations are linked to specific flights.
- **Flight Search & Filtering**: Users can filter flights by departure location, arrival location, and date range.
- **Occupancy & Availability Checks**: Prevent reservations on fully booked flights and verify airplane availability before flight assignment.
- **Unique Reservation Codes**: Automatically generate unique reservation codes that remain unchanged even after updates.
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for reservation creation, flight updates, and email address changes.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations using the `@Async` annotation for background tasks.
- **DTO & Mapper Usage**: Efficient entity-to-DTO mapping via dedicated mappers (e.g., `FlightMapper`, `ReservationMapper`, `AirplaneMapper`).
- **Global Error Handling**: Custom error messages for specific failure scenarios, such as unavailable airplanes or fully booked flights.
- **Email Templates**: Template-based email notifications via JavaMailSender and Thymeleaf.

## Exception Handling

The application features global exception handling for a smooth user experience. Some exceptions include:

- `AirplaneNotAvailableException`: Thrown when an airplane is unavailable.
- `FlightFullyBookedException`: Raised when a flight is fully booked.
- `InvalidFlightTimeException`: Raised when a flightâ€™s departure time is after the arrival time.
